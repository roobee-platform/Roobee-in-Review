# Roobee-in-Review
Alright, 2023 is here and itâ€™s about time that we, as per tradition, take a look at the progress made by the Roobee team throughout the year we left behind!

Roobee is not an open-source project. However, in our development reports, we try to regularly share info on the work done.
